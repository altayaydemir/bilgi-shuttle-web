- [Redux](https://github.com/reactjs/redux) as the data layer, with the assistance of libraries like react-router-redux, redux-thunk and redux-logger.

- Polyfill of the native Fetch API, [whatwg-fetch](https://github.com/github/fetch) for async data loading.

- React Bootstrap for styling.

- Karma, Mocha and Chai as the core of testing libraries.

- Enzyme for testing React Components.

- fetch-mock and redux-mock-store for testing Redux Modules.
